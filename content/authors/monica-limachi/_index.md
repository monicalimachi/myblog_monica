I'm from La Paz, Bolivia. Traveler and enjoy to learn about different languages, cities, cultures, places, music.

I enjoy learning about DevOps culture:

Do you want to learn more about the culture, then I'll be posting different articles in spanish and english, about new requirements, technologies, tools.

I did this blog using Hugo, and it's very funny to try  different languages and use them.

Learn more and contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/gohugoio).
