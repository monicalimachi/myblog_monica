I'm from La Paz, Bolivia. Traveler and I enjoy to learn about different languages, cities, cultures, places, music.

I enjoy learning about DevOps culture:



Do you want to learn more about this culture of work?, then I'll be posting different articles in spanish and english, about new requirements, technologies, tools.

I did this blog using Hugo, and it's very funny to learn different programming languages and use them.
